## Description
This component is used to align its content.

Aligning content in emails sucks. This is because [support for many css properties are wildly
inconsistent between email clients](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/).

Therefore, we unfortunately use tables, because it is the best supported means for aligning content
in email clients.

## Props
<Props of={Section} />

## StandardStory
export const standardStyles = {
	paper: {
		padding: 10,
		height: 250,
		width: 500
	}
};

<Preview>
	<Story name="standard">
		{() => {
			const align = select(
				"align",
				{
					left: "left",
					right: "right",
					center: "center"
				},
				"left"
			);
			return (
				<Section align={align}>
					<Paper style={standardStyles.paper}>
						<p>This content is {align} aligned.</p>
					</Paper>
				</Section>
			);
		}}
	</Story>
</Preview>
